# Flight Price Analytics
## Introduction
People generally feel that booking of flight ticket should be done as earlier as possible to get the best deal. 
But does booking flight tickets earlier always yield the cheapest price? Or is there a specific day of the week to book 
a flight or to travel on that minimizes the price of the tickets? To answer these question we’ve setup a data pipeline to 
retrieve and store flight price data in a structured format in Cosmos DB. 
In our analysis, we derive insights about the trends in flight prices, the cheapest day and part of the day to travel and 
compare our results with the study done by ‘Hopper.com’. Secondly, we create a vacation recommendation engine, by using flight
data collected and combining it with points of interest data in those specific locations to inspire a person for the next travel.
